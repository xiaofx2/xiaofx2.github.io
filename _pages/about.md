## About Me

I am currently a PhD student at [Molecular Engineering & Sciences Institute](https://www.moles.washington.edu/), University of Washington, working with Prof. [Scott Dunham](https://dunham.ece.uw.edu/) in [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.uw.edu/).

I completed my bachelor in Chemistry in July 2018 from [Department of Chemistry](https://chem.nankai.edu.cn/), Nankai University.

The goal of my research is to use numerical method, first principles computational modeling, machine learning, and materials informatics to develop predictive models for semiconductor materials and devices.

## Research Interests

Material/Device Simulation and Machine Learning - Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD), Density Functional Theory (DFT), Monte Carlo Method, Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning.

## News
